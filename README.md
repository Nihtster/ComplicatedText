# ComplicatedText

ComplicatedText is an over-the-top text generator that recreates a given sentence through the use of a character randomizer.

## Description

ComplicatedText is comparable to traditional split-flap message boards seen in places like airports and train stations. 
This program was inspired by an Instagram post where the concept was created in Python. This project recreates that concept but in Java.
