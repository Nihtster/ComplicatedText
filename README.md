## Description

ComplicatedText is a digital reacreation of the traditional split-flap message boards seen in places like airports and train stations where characters
are cycled through until the desired message is reached. The project, which was inspired by an Instagram post that implemented the concept through Python,
aims to do just that and them some. As of right now, ComplicatedText is a testing platform for a future concept that will add functionality to what was simply a project done for fun.

## Roadmap

[x] Design the concept code that implements the split-flap concept in Java <br/>
[ ] Design and create a JavaFX GUI for the base code<br/>
[ ] Publish a working .exe or .jar version of the project<br/>

## Goals

As mentioned, this project is a testing platform, but what exactly is being tested? Below are the goals I aim to achieve with this project.
There is no set end goal as this project is more to learn and gain more experience in certain aspects of programming and development.
Below is a list of some concepts I hope to gain from this project: <br/>

- Program design & optiization (Through Java)
- GUI fundementals and experience (Through JavaFX)
- Multi-threading (Through Java)
- Github fundementals and repository maintenance
- Personal software design practices & routines
